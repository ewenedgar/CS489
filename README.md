# CS489 Problem Statement for a Restaurant Menu App 
Background: 
In today's fast-paced world, dining out has become a common practice for many individuals and 
families. However, choosing a restaurant and deciding what to eat can often be time-consuming 
and frustrating due to a lack of easily accessible information. Potential diners frequently face 
challenges in finding current menus, special dietary options, and pricing information before they 
arrive at a restaurant. Additionally, for people with specific dietary restrictions or preferences, such 
as vegan, gluten-free, or halal options, identifying suitable restaurants can be even more daunting. 
 
Problem: 
The primary issue is the absence of a centralized platform where users can quickly view up-to-date 
menus, prices, and dietary information from multiple restaurants within their vicinity. Current 
solutions like individual restaurant websites, social media pages, or third-party apps often contain 
outdated information, lack comprehensive coverage of all local dining options, or do not cater 
specifically to users with dietary restrictions. This situation leads to a suboptimal dining experience 
and restricts customers' ability to make informed decisions about where and what to eat. 
 
Opportunity: 
There is a significant opportunity to enhance the dining experience by providing a mobile app that 
aggregates the most current restaurant menus, along with detailed descriptions and prices, for a 
variety of restaurants in a user's immediate area. Such a platform should also offer robust filtering 
tools to accommodate various dietary needs and preferences, ensuring all users can find meals 
that meet their dietary requirements. 
 
Objective: 
The goal is to develop a user-friendly mobile application that: 
• Displays an up-to-date menu from various restaurants within a user’s locality. 
• Offers detailed information on menu items including descriptions, images, prices, and 
dietary labels (e.g., vegan, gluten-free, organic, etc.). 
• Allows users to filter restaurants and menu items based on dietary preferences, price range, 
and other preferences like cuisine type. 
• Enhances the decision-making process for diners by providing features such as user 
reviews, ratings for dishes, and the ability to bookmark favorite restaurants. 
• Supports restaurant owners by providing a platform to update their menu information easily 
and promote their special offers or new items to attract customers. 
 
 
Target Audience: 
• Diners who looking for a convenient way to discover dining options that meet their dietary 
preferences or restrictions. 
• Busy individuals who prefer to plan their dining options ahead of visiting a restaurant. 
• Tourists who are unfamiliar with the dining landscape in new cities. 
• Restaurant owners who wish to reach a broader customer base by showcasing their menus 
and special promotions. 
Benefit: 
By solving the issues outlined, the app will not only streamline the process of choosing a restaurant 
but also enrich the dining experience, cater to health and lifestyle choices, and ultimately support 
the local gastronomy ecosystem. For restaurant owners, it offers a direct channel to communicate 
with potential customers, helping to drive sales and customer satisfaction.
